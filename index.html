  	<h1>This is a very short chapter book</h1>
  	  <h2>Chapter One: In which we meet the main characters</h2>
  	  <p>
  	  <a class="ogreintro">Once upon a time, there was a very funny looking ogre. Her name was Snabby Crablepat. </a>
  	  <a class="donkeyintro">Snabby was funny looking because she did not look like an ogre at all. In fact, she looked more like a purple donkey.</a>

  	  <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
  	  <a id="randomthoughts"><p>What kind of a website would I want to build? I have no earthly idea. The idea of having any piece of myself out there in the ether for anyone to see and to comment on and to judge is unappealing.  We have the capability to create whoever we want to be online, and that person can be far from our true selves.  As one who is afraid of judgement and defines myself as hopefully ever changing, I am reluctant to project anything that could be used to put me in a box and examine me under a microscrope.  <img src="images/minipiggie.png">Perhaps that is a self-important way to look at the world (assuming anyone would give enough of a shit to microscopically evaluate me).  Perhaps it doesn't matter. Either way, I find it incredibly intimidating to consider creating anything that could be viewed by ALL. Eeek. And beyond that, produced without affirmation or pre-judgment by anyone else whose opinion I hold high.  This would require me to actually trust my own work, and decide that it was good enough on its own and not care about the judgment of others.</a></p>
